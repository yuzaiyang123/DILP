# DILP: Differentiable render in multi-view Image-Language Pretraining for zero-shot 3D shape understanding

Thanks for your attention. In this repo, we provide the code for the paper "DILP: Differentiable render in multi-view Image-Language Pretraining for zero-shot 3D shape understanding".

# Open-source  schedule

**20 Jul 2023.** We provide an example of differentiable render in [differentiable-render](differentiable-render.py).

The full project will be open source after this paper is accepted.
